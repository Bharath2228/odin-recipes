    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These spicy lobster tails are so easy to make. Just a note on the lobster tails in supermarkets: if they're not frozen, they've been frozen and then thawed. So, bypass the 'fresh' for the frozen, which are fresher.</p>

        <li>2 tablespoons chopped tarragon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sriracha sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>4 frozen lobster tails - thawed, split in half, and deveined</li>
    </ul>
